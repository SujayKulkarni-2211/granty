Sustainable funding is a core priority.</p>\n\n<h3>Program Impact and Model Potential</h3>\n<p>This initiative builds upon the success of our existing smaller community garden, demonstrating a clear community need and interest.  Its expansion significantly increases our capacity to serve.  The project\u2019s success will serve as a replicable model for other communities facing similar challenges, showcasing the powerful impact of community gardens on food access and community building.</p>\n\n<h3>Progress and Results Documentation</h3>\n<p>We will meticulously track volunteer recruitment, produce harvested, families served, and workshop attendance.  Monthly progress reports will be provided to the grant provider, culminating in a comprehensive final report detailing achievements, challenges, and lessons learned. Success will be measured by increased produce yield, volunteer participation, community engagement, and the number of families directly benefiting from the project.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Attachments</h2>\n<p>The following documents are attached:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Copy of current IRS determination letter (501(c)(3) status)</li>\n    <li>Statement verifying payroll tax payments</li>\n    <li>Organizational structure documentation (officers, directors, board responsibilities, key personnel resumes)</li>\n    <li>Financial documentation (grant budget, list of other funders, annual operating budget, audited financial statement, letters of support, annual report)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2>Budget</h2>\n\n<h3>Budget Period: January 1, 2024 - December 31, 2024</h3>\n\n<p><em>(This section would contain a detailed, itemized budget, including personnel costs, materials, equipment, utilities, etc.  A separate table would show anticipated revenue sources.)</em></p>\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Expense Category</th>\n            <th>Amount</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Personnel Costs (Salaries, Payroll Taxes, Benefits)</td>\n            <td>$15,000</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Materials (seeds, tools, soil, etc.)</td>\n            <td>$5,000</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Construction (raised beds, irrigation)</td>\n            <td>$10,000</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Educational Workshops (materials, instructor fees)</td>\n            <td>$2,000</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Marketing &amp; Outreach</td>\n            <td>$1,000</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Contingency Fund</td>\n            <td>$2,000</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><strong>Total Expenses</strong></td>\n            <td><strong>$35,000</strong></td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Revenue Source</th>\n            <th>Amount</th>\n            <th>Status</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Grant Request (This Proposal)</td>\n            <td>$50,000</td>\n            <td>Requested</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Anytown Rotary Club Grant</td>\n            <td>$2,000</td>\n            <td>Confirmed</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>In-Kind Donations (volunteer labor)</td>\n            <td>$18,000</td>\n            <td>Anticipated</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><strong>Total Income</strong></td>\n            <td><strong>$70,000</strong></td>\n            <td></td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><em>Note:  The budget reflects a $35,000 total expenses and $70,000 in anticipated income.
